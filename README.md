# SalaryperHour
Notes:
- This is assuming that our db is postgres
- Code will only run if you put variables for the db information
- this code needs pandas and psycopg2 libraries to run

How to run:
- run upload.py on scheduler to upload employees and timesheets csv
- run calc.py on scheduler to calculate and insert salary per hour.
